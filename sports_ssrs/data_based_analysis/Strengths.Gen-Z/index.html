            Based on the phrases and percentages given, the majority of your target audience appears to show an overwhelming interest in football, particularly in Tottenham Hotspur, which is indicated by the phrase 'Tottenham Hotspur best atmosphere' and it contributes about 23% of the total interests or reactions of your target population. 

On the other hand, the weird phrase 'huge, huge' is a bit vague but it may suggest an enthusiasm or excitement for something, contributing to around 22% of the total array of interests.

The phrase 'Boxing Day is not Christmas' could indicate a segment of your audience which is interested in Boxing Day and contrary to popular belief, these individuals see it distinctively separate from Christmas. This interest contributes nearly 8% of the total interests. 

Lastly, the phrase 'Wrestling, wrestling' clearly suggests an audience segmentation with a keen interest in wrestling, however, it contributes 0% to the selection of interest, indicating it's a very minor or irrelevant segment within the greater target population.

Taking these aspects into account might help you in formulating an effective and focused marketing strategy.
