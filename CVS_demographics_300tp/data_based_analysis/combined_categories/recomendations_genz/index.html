Invest in and highlight excellent customer service: With terms such as "highly, absolutely, professional" and "Thanks, Patient, Shout - Great costumer service!" being mentioned significantly more by Gen-Z, it shows the emphasis among this consumer base on high-quality service. Drawing on customer experiences showcased in reviews like "Ian was absolutely the most pleasant and helpful associate ever encountered," marketing campaigns can highlight the brand's commitment to top-notch, personalized customer service.
    </li><br/>
<li>
Continue to maintain clean and inviting store environments:  "Nice, super, cle" and "Beautiful, cle" indicate the appreciation for clean, well-organized stores among older generations. Leveraging phrases like "very clean and organize" and "nice store everyone was super helpful and nice" from customer reviews in marketing materials will assure customers of a comfortable shopping experience.
    </li><br/>
<li>
Address concerns and improve shipping services:  Negative terms such as "Absolutely horrible shipping services" indicate dissatisfaction with shipping services among older shoppers. Review feedback like "absolutely horrible shipping services..." and "out of 300$ because ups delivered my package to wrong address" should be addressed promptly to enhance customer satisfaction and retain these shoppers.
    </li><br/>
<li>
Highlight professional staff and salon services to attract Gen-Z:  'Evelin is the best', 'beautiful salon', and 'Kyla was really nice and helpful' underlie the value Gen-Z shoppers place on professional services. Example customer reviews such as 'Evelin did a great job helping me find my shade...' and 'Kyla was really nice and helpful' can be utilized in marketing initiatives to draw attention to the high level of expertise within the brand's staff and salon offerings.
    </li><br/>
<li>
Pay attention to employees' presentation:  The phrase 'Most employees look like they rolled' reveals a weakness indicating dissatisfaction with staff presentation among the Gen-Z demographic. Improvements in this area and showcasing a well-presented staff could enhance the store's image among this group.
    </li><br/>
<li>
Action plans against discriminatory behavior:  The term 'Racist old lady' shows a grievous concern among Gen-Z shoppers. This issue should be strictly handled with effective policies and communication of the companyâ€™s actions against any form of discrimination. This will contribute positively to the company's reputation and help gain trust among diverse customers.
