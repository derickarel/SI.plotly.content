<li>Encourage Positive Staff Interactions:  As per the strengths observed in both the Boomer and younger generation categories, shoppers appreciated helpful and friendly staff. For example, “Overly helpful” mentioned by younger shoppers and "Evelin is the best" mentioned by Boomers. Therefore, investing in training for staff on improving customer interaction and focusing on customer satisfaction can yield positive results.</li><br/>
<li>Maintain Cleanliness and Organization:  Maintaining and improving the cleanliness, organization, and brightness of the store is another area to look into. Younger shoppers have mentioned their appreciation for how “freakishly clean the Auburn outlet mall location is.” Implementing these higher cleanliness standards across other locations can significantly improve customer perception.</li><br/>
<li>Rewarding Staff on Positive Reviews:  Several positive reviews mention specific staff members, such as "Ian was absolutely the most pleasant and helpful associate" by younger customers or "Love Stephanie Berry! Great haircut and so nice!" from Boomers. Encouraging and rewarding staff based on positive customer feedback will help drive superior customer service.</li><br/>
<li>Improve Customer Experience:  Given the examples of weaknesses, enhancing the customer experience is crucial. For instance, Boomers referred to "Rudely rude" staff and younger customers called out what they perceived as "Worst costumer service ever." Training staff to properly handle all customer interactions, especially complaints, can drastically improve the overall customer experience.</li><br/>
<li>Product Availability and Visibility:  "Really nice staff who helped me find Haus Labs" was mentioned as a strength by Boomers. This suggests that improvements can be made in product availability and visibility in the store to ensure customers can easily find what they need.</li><br/>
<li>Address Negative Staff Perceptions:  One weakness cited by Boomers was "Most employees look like they rolled," which suggests a negative perception of staff appearance. Adjusting staff appearance guidelines and ensuring staff are neat and professional-looking at all times can help address this issue.</li><br/>
