<li>Highlight Excellent Customer Service: Based on consistent strength reviews, customers appreciate the outstanding service they receive. Consider promotions or advertising campaigns emphasizing the excellent customer service and employees' friendliness and helpfulness at CVS.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Promote Skincare and Beauty Services: With many positive comments about good eyebrow shaping, make up and skincare services (for example, "Amal awesome job concealing my dark spot", "Great cosmetic service at Estee Lauder"), it might be advantageous to draw attention to these services in marketing efforts to cater to those who value these offerings.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Emphasize Clean, Comfortable Store Environment: Reviews showed customers enjoyed the clean and air-conditioned environment. This suggests a store perception campaign could reassure customers about comfort and cleanliness across all locations.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Address Wait Times: There are complaints about "Ridiculously long lines". Addressing this weakness and communicating updates to checkout procedures or wait time improvements could enhance customer satisfaction.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Improve Accessibility: Some remarks like "Not Handicapped Friendly" indicate a gap in accessibility. Improving store accessibility and promoting these changes in marketing materials can serve to enhance the customer experience and emphasize CVS's commitment to all customers.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Work on Staff Training: Reviews like "Rudely rude" or "Most employees look like they rolled" show customers weren't pleased with some store staff's attitudes. Investing in staff training and showcasing this commitment in public communications could bolster the company's image.<br/><br/></li>
