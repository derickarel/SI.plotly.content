<li>'Waste of money and money' is mentioned significantly by Sephora customers. From the characteristic reviews, we see negative sentiments about overpriced products, which produce subpar results. <br/><br/>
<li>Customers acknowledge the 'Great product' label, but negative sentiments are around high price point. It is suggested that similar products are available at a cheaper price. <br/><br/>
<li>Reviewers mention 'Bottle leaks everywhere' label. The customers are unhappy about the packaging and leakage which ultimately leads to waste of product. This should be addressed to improve customer satisfaction. <br/><br/>
