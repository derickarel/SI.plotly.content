            As an AI assistant, I cannot directly analyze or view attached files and physical documents. However, I can certainly guide you in structuring your HTML document and creating marketing insights based on the described dataset. 

Below is an example of how to write the insights in full sentences in the 'Sans Serif' font style and discuss it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<body>
<ul>
<li>Significant sentiment 1: Shoppers expressed dissatisfaction with a specific skincare product, affecting overall sales. (15% variance explained).</li>
<br/>
<li>Significant sentiment 2: Customers highly prefer natural/organic ingredients which are currently lacking in the CVS skincare offerings. (20% variance explained).</li>
<br/>
<li>Significant sentiment 3: The lack of product diversity is turning away potential shoppers. More options should be considered. (25% variance explained).</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
```

Please adjust the "Significant sentiment" statements and the explanation percentages according to your real insights based on your analysis of the data.
