<h2>Marketing Overview</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on the analysis of the data set, we can determine that two issues stood out for the Boomer segment of Walgreens customer base: Slow drive thru services and poor Customer service. These recurrent complaints are pointing out significant weaknesses in the organization that need addressing. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Marketing Recommendations</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Recommendation 1:</b></p>
<p>As an immediate measure, marketing should work in conjunction with operations team to identify possible reasons for the slow service at the drive-thru. Since several customers identified this as a significant issue, it might be a constraint with the physical logistics, staffing, or processes. Once the reasons have been identified, changes should be implemented accordingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Recommendation 2:</b></p>
<p>A marketing campaign can be initiated to promote the digital prescription and refill services offered by Walgreens. This will not only be a convenience for boomer customers who value efficient service, but will also reduce the load on drive-thru services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Recommendation 3:</b></p>
<p>For improving customer service, marketing should collaborate with HR to enhance training programs. Special emphasis should be placed on training personnel that interact with customers the most to promote excellent service behavior. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Recommendation 4:</b></p>
<p>Customer satisfaction surveys should be introduced as a means of acquiring constant feedback and for better understanding the needs and wants, particularly of the Boomer segment. This valuable insight can be used for service improvement and enhancing customer service training programs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Recommendation 5:</b></p>
<p>A consumer awareness campaign communicating improvements in both drive-thru services and customer service should be launched. This will give the Boomer customers, as well as other customers, assurance that their concerns are taken seriously and addressed efficiently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Recommendation 6:</b></p>
<p>Finally, a loyalty program can be introduced to encourage repeat visits. It may offer special perks or benefits to the customers, such as express service at the drive-thru or priority access to promotions or deals.</p>
