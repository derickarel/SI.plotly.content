            <b>1. Improve Customer Service Quality:</b> A significant portion of the dissatisfaction stems from poor customer service. Invest in customer service training to improve customers' experience—focusing on communication, problem-solving, and empathy. Monitor improvements closely using customer satisfaction surveys.

        <p>
            <b>2. Expedite Service Speed:</b> 'Slow' surfaced frequently in the reports, indicating dissatisfaction with service speed, especially at pharmacies. Streamline operations to reduce service time and consider hiring additional staff during peak hours.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>3. Enhance Phone Pick-up Efficiency:</b> Several complaints were related to phones not being answered promptly. Strategies can be developed to tackle this problem such as workforce management or implementing an efficient Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>4. Invest in Digital Infrastructure :</b> Consider developing a robust online ordering and query handling system to reduce pressure on physical stores and improve overall efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>5. Foster a Positive Brand Image:</b> Negative customer reviews can harm a brand's image. Keep a close eye on online customer feedback across various platforms to proactively address complaints and correct misconceptions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>6. Promote Value for Money:</b> 'Waste of money' is a significant concern. Advertisement campaigns can be run to highlight the value for money of services and goods offered. Simultaneously, consider running promotional offers to attract cost-conscious customers.
