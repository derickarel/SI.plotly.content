<p>Based on the provided data, areas of significant mention by CVS millennials customers were identified. The thematic analysis revealed that key concerns focused mostly on service quality. The issues raised included poor customer service like unanswered phone calls, erroneous prescription processing, and displeasure with the automated phone system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Marketing Recommendations</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. Improve Call Center Service</strong><br>Given the large volume of negative reviews related to unanswered calls or automated phone systems, CVS should improve its call center services. This could involve hiring more personnel or improving training practices to ensure all calls are promptly and effectively addressed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Enhance Prescription Processing System</strong><br>Multiple customers mentioned issues with prescriptions not being ready on time, or even receiving wrong ones. Implementing a robust and efficient prescription processing system is vital to reduce these occurrences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Personalized Customer Service</strong><br>Millennials have been cited in numerous studies as valuing personalized service. As such, CVS should strive to create a customer experience that caters to individual needs. For instance, providing personalized product recommendations or health tips could help enhance customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Improve Automated Phone System</strong><br>The dissatisfaction with the automated phone system suggests a need for a review and possible overhaul of the system. Options could include simplifying the system, using more natural language processing technology, or providing clearer options for customers to talk to a human representative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Invest in Staff Training</strong><br>A number of reviews pointed out perceived incompetence or unhelpfulness among staff members. Investing in comprehensive staff training programs would not only improve employees' skills but also their ability to handle complex customer situations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. Utilize Digital Channels</strong><br>Millennials are a digital-native generation which provides an opportunity for CVS to leverage digital channels for marketing and customer service. For instance, apps or online portals could be used to update customers on prescription status, provide health information or deal with queries. Integrating more digital solutions in their service operations could greatly appeal to this group.</p>
