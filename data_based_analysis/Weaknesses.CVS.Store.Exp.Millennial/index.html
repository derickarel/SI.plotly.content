<h2>Marketing Overview</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the given data, there are four key elements which have been frequently mentioned by the age group of 100 which is related to the CVS Store Experience; they are taking significantly longer to prepare prescriptions, poor customer service especially in terms of phone engagement, difficulty in dealing with automated phone services, and wrong insurance information and medical data. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highest percentage variance explained (100%) is related to the 'DONT BUY' label, suggesting a severe negative perception towards the pharmacy. Other labels also indicate dissatisfaction with the service, such as 'phone, hold, over - Terrible service', and 'insurance, information, wrong - Horrible serviceâ€™. Overall, the implication of these results suggests a need for CVS to improve its service towards millennials and centenarians who may have different buying behaviors and expectations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Marketing Recommendations</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Prioritize Improvement in Prescription Filling Time: As preparation time is a recurring issue, CVS should look into its operations and implement optimization processes to speed up the service, thus improving customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Enhanced Training for Customer Service: The negative comments on phone hold times and being hung up on indicate a need for customer service training. This should focus on efficient handling of customer inquiries and complaints, and maintain professionalism at all times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Evaluate and Realign Automated phone services: Find ways to simplify or enhance the process of automated calls so that it becomes a welcome tool for customers rather than a hassle. Accumulate enough data from customers to understand their needs and grievances and implement the required changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Improve Accuracy of Customer Data: The complaints about wrong insurance information indicate a problem with data accuracy. The company should ensure proper data management protocols are enforced to avoid these issues which could affect the company's reputation and customer trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Monitor Quality: Implement or intensify quality control measures to ensure each patient goes home with the correct medication. Staff should be properly trained on how to handle the medications and the prescriptions to avoid errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Focus Groups: CVS can conduct a focus group or leverage customer feedback to understand their pain points better. It should be proactive in handling issues raised by customers and find solutions that will not just fix the problems, but enhance their overall experience with the pharmacy.</p>
