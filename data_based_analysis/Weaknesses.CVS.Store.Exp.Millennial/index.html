This can be accomplished by hiring more staff, providing adequate training to existing staff, and incorporating a more effective system for answering customer calls promptly.
        </p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
        2. Efficient Prescription Management: The company should take steps to reduce wait times for prescriptions. This can be achieved by implementing efficient inventory management systems, hiring more pharmacists, and improving the overall process related to prescription readiness.
        </p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
        3. Effective Medication Dispensing: To address the problem of incorrect dispensing of medications, CVS should integrate strict quality control checks. Moreover, staff training should emphasize the importance of double-checking medications before they are given to customers.
        </p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
        5. Correct Store Timings: Store hours should be clearly communicated and adhered to. Inconsistencies or inaccuracies in store timings can lead to dissatisfaction amongst customers. This issue can be tackled by ensuring that the operating hours displayed online are accurate and always updated.
        </p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
        6. Revamp Automated Phone System: A significant amount of frustration seems to stem from the automated phone system. CVS could consider making their automated phone system more user-friendly, or offer an option to quickly connect the caller to a live customer service representative for further assistance.
