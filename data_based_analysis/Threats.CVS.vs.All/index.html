        <li><b>Improve Product Satisfaction:</b> Given the significant customer satisfaction with the versatility and longevity of the competitor's products, CVS could focus on enhancing the formula of their skincare and makeup products for better results and long lasting effects. For example, customers love competitors' 8-in-1 makeup product that stays on even in hot weather, CVS could develop a similar multi-purpose product with a focus on longevity.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Promote Hydrating and Moisturizing Products:</b> Many customers are praising the competitor's products for keeping their skin fresh, hydrated, and shiny. CVS should emphasize on the moisturizing and hydrating properties of their skincare products in adverts and promotions. Indeed, customers loved using the Lip Mask and the night moisturizer, CVS could offer similar, highly moisturizing products.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Focus on Innovation:</b> Customers appreciate innovative technology in skincare products, as per characteristic reviews. CVS should invest more in R&D to create products with unique features and technologies. For example, the Nord's Cosmic Cream was highly praised for its hydrating and plumping properties, CVS could create similar innovative products to attract these customers.</li>
