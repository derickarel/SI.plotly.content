            The data shows that CVS performs quite well in aspects like customer service and maintaining a well-stocked, clean environment. High percentage variances indicate that these strengths are strongly associated with the company. Concerning weaknesses, Gen-Z customers have pointed out issues related to long phone hold times and poor readiness of medications, while older generations have expressed dissatisfaction with aspects like service quality and cleanliness. Some of the weaknesses reported by both groups include complaints about drive-thru speed and customer service disruptions. This data can inform improvements for the company to better meet the needs of both generational groups.
