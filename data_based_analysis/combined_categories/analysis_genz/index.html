            The analysis of strength and weaknesses among Generation Z and older generations provides notable marketing implications which can be leveraged to enhance customer experience and build better marketing strategies. The distinction of strengths and weaknesses related to Generation Z and older consumers could bring insights into how CVS is perceived by different age groups. 

On strengths, Generation Z appreciates great customer service and the offering of a broad range of products including groceries and frozen food, indicating the effectiveness of CVS's service and its wide-diversity of products to this demographic. On the other hand, older customers have expressed a particular preference for great customer service and commented positively on the cleanliness and how well stocked the CVS stores are, implying good customer relationship management and supply chain management are essential in appealing to this demographic. 

As far as weaknesses go, Generation Z are concerned about long phone hold times, as well as problems with medication availability and poor customer service; that implies CVS needs to focus more on enhancing its call center efficiency and ensuring the availability of medications to this demographic. For the older generations, matters such as high prices, poor store conditions and perceived poor treatment of customers are of concern. This suggests that CVS needs to reassess its pricing strategies, store cleanliness and the quality of customer service, especially for older customers.

These insights suggest that CVS should continue its efforts in maintaining a high level of customer service, diversify its products offerings to meet changing consumer preferences, and improve aspects of the operation that causes discontent among customers such as call waiting times, medicine availability and pricing and store cleanliness.
