<li>There are numerous strengths within the customer service staff as mentioned by the Gen-Z and older generations. Positive mentions include "Great CS from Margaret", "Beyond, above", and "His, Him, Man - Great customer service!". However, there are also areas of weakness noted such as "Phone hold times are horrible", "Lazy people worse service ever", and "Rude customer service". Improving staff training and focusing on customer service could greatly benefit the customer perception of the company.</p><br/><br/></li>
<li>Many shoppers appreciate branding elements like the clean, fully stocked environment and the store atmosphere. Shoppers mentioned phrases like "Pleasurable shopping experience", "Everything I needed", and "Clean and well stocked". To make the store even more enjoyable, cleanliness standards should be raised to avoid customer dissatisfaction as reflected in reviews such as "Dirty, dirty".</p><br/><br/></li>
<li>Having all items on hand that customers are looking for is a major satisfaction factor. Customers mentioned "Found everything I needed" and "Clean and well stocked". As it is a strength that could be improved upon, regular inventory checks and order improvements could make the shopping experience even better for customers. </p> <br/><br/></li>
<li>Customers in Gen Z showed a specific dissatisfaction with drive-thru service, with reviews such as "slow drive-thru", and "Takes forever drive thru". This indicates the need for CVS to streamline the drive-thru experience to improve efficiency and reduce wait times for customers.</p><br/><br/></li>
<li>CVS customers have voiced concerns about 'price gouging', an issue that could be damaging the company's reputation among older generations. CVS could consider reviewing its cost strategies to maintain competitive value for customers. Good pricing could turn this weakness into a strength.</p><br/><br/></li>
<li>Shoppers commented "Never have meds ready poor customer service". Efficient medication preparation is essential for customer satisfaction, especially for customers in need of medicine. Improving this area could solve this weakness brought up by Gen Z customers.</p><br/><br/></li>
