1. Based on the strength categories, customers appreciate an excellent customer service experience. For example, customer Margaret was noted in reviews for providing "Great CS." Therefore, focusing on maintaining and enhancing the level of customer service, particularly through staff training and reward initiatives, would further strengthen the company's rapport with customers.</p><br/>
<p>

2. Another strength highlighted was the remark that the store is "Clean and well stocked." Cleanliness and availability are highly valued by customers, indicating that maintaining store cleanliness, organization, and ensuring items are well-stocked should continue to be a top priority. Specially emphasized grocery and frozen food availability will meet shoppers' convenience needs, particularly for Gen-Z shoppers.</p><br/>
<p>

3. A notable weakness addressed by customers was the "Phone hold times are horrible". To improve customer satisfaction, it would be beneficial to reduce these hold times either by increasing staffing at peak times or by improving phone service systems, possibly incorporating callback or live chat options to minimize the delay.</p><br/>
<p>

4. Another complaint from customers emphasized specific employees' rudeness â€“ "Phone, Called, Answer - Rude customer service." This issue can be addressed through additional training focused on efficient and polite communication, particularly over the phone. Also, implementing stricter measures to monitor and gauge workers' interactions with customers can be used to ensure adherence to customer service standards.</p><br/>
<p>

5. Notably, customers seem dissatisfied with the drive-through service, stating it "Takes forever". To counter this, CVS should prioritize increasing the efficiency of drive-through operations. This efficiency could be achieved by introducing additional staff during peak hours, streamlining the order and pickup process, or implementing technological advances such as digital order boards or automatic dispensers.</p><br/>
<p>

6. Negative reviews mentioned issues like "Dirty, dirty" and price-related concerns - "Price gouging". It is recommended to conduct regular cleanliness checks and respond consistently to hygiene problems in the stores. Furthermore, price consistency should be promoted across online and in-store offerings to meet customer expectations and combat perceived price gouging. Overall, being responsive to customers and addressing their concerns promptly can improve the weaknesses identified in both Gen-Z and older generation shoppers.
