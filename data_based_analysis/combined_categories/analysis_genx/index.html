Gen-X appreciates good customer service and the availability of grocery and frozen food items, indicating efficient operations. Yet there are criticism of the company's medication readiness and some unresolved customer complaints. These findings should inform strategies going forward to address issues, leverage strengths, and improve customer satisfaction.  CVS receives high praise for customer service from all generations and Gen-X's satisfaction with our service and grocery options. However, areas for improvement are evident in our service-related processes such as phone responses and drive-thru efficiencies. It is essential to address these issues head on and ramp up our strengths to keep customers satisfied, regardless of which generation they belong to.
