            Based on customer feedback, Gen-X customers at CVS stores appreciate the exceptional customer service, with several mentions of accommodating staff such as Margaret and Michael. They also enjoy a pleasurable shopping experience, often finding everything they need in clean, well-stocked stores. Unfortunately, there have been several instances of poor customer service experiences, including uncomfortable hold times on phone calls, slow drive-through service, and medications not being ready as promised. These are areas that CVS may need to address to ensure the continued loyalty of their Gen-X customers.
