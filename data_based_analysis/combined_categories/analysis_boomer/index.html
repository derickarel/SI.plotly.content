            The marketing analysis of CVS highlights distinct strengths and weaknesses across different customer age groups. Baby boomers appreciate CVS's customer service, the satisfactory range of grocery and frozen food items, as well as their rewards program. However, notable frustrations include issues with hold times on phone calls, availability of medications, and perceived high prices. Younger demographics also value the customer service at CVS, along with the overall pleasing shopping experience. Their main grievances revolve around a slow drive-thru service, understaffing, and problematic communication regarding appointments. Understanding these perspectives can help CVS enhance their strengths and address their weaknesses more effectively. The in-depth data will be provided in the attached HTML document.
