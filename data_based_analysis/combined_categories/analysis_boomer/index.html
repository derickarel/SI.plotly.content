            Based on the given data, it seems that Baby Boomers appreciate the excellent customer service they receive at CVS. They have a high regard for employees who go above and beyond their call of duty, notable rewards programs, product availability, and view it as a preferable alternative to competitors like Walgreens. However, they express dissatisfaction with slow drive-thru services, understaffing issues, long phone hold times, and poor medication readiness.
