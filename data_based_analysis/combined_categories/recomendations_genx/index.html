1. As a strength, it is found that CVS employees across generations provide excellent service, going above and beyond in ensuring customer satisfaction. (e.g. "Great CS from Margaret", "Best, Beyond, Smile - Best Customer Service!") and this is verified by positive customer reviews. Marketing efforts should capitalize on this, focusing on promoting the high-quality service from representatives across various channels. Consider publicizing customer testimonial campaigns or hosting employee appreciation events that consumers can participate in.
<br/><br/>
2. It is noted that the store is   stocked well, clean, and satisfying for the older generation (e.g. "Clean and well stocked", "Everything I needed"). However, CVS can enhance its store layout and cleanliness to attract more Gen-Z shoppers. This may involve introducing tech-based interactive store maps for a seamless shopping experience or employing social media campaigns about stocking and cleanliness to assure the young consumers about the conduciveness of the in-store experience.
<br/><br/>
3. Reviews suggest that good service and excellent skills are appreciated by the Gen-Z shoppers (e.g. "Great service and excellent skills giving"). Given this, CVS could promote skills training programs for its staff and market these advancements to Gen-Z customers. Leveraging social media for this campaign would be especially effective in reaching this particular demographic.
<br/><br/>
4. The major weakness pointed out by both the older and younger generations involves poor phone service ("Phone hold times are horrible", "Phone, Called, Answer - Rude customer service"). CVS should invest in improving its phone service. Providing training to employees on phone etiquette and efficient servicing can address this. Furthermore, CVS can consider introducing or promoting alternative ways customers could reach out and be assured quick responses (e.g. live chat feature, email support, help via social media direct messaging).
<br/><br/>
5. It is also necessary to address the unattractive customer service reviews from Gen-Z particularly ("Never have meds ready poor customer service", "Ridiculous Customer Service"). This may imply Gen-Z customers preferring a quick, no-hassle shopping experience. CVS may benefit from introducing or enhancing express shopping services, like a faster checkout process, improving its app for easy shopping or curating special speedy service lines for Gen-Z consumers.
<br/><br/>
6. A common point of dissatisfaction among the older consumers involves price-related issues ("Price gouging"). CVS should ensure that pricing policies are clear, competitive and transparent. This might involve clearer and more accessible in-store, online and mobile platform price listings. Additionally, regular audits on pricing can be done to ensure alignment with external and internal factors.
