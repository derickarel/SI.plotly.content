1. Our customers have given positive feedback about our customer service, taking the time to name specific employees who have been a great help. Many of these expressions of customer satisfaction come from Millennials, who praise the professionalism of our team. They've mentioned phrases like "Pleasurable shopping experience," "Great CS from Margaret," and "Thank, team, amazing." We should build upon this strength and continue investing in training and developing our team to maintain this high level of service consistently.
<br/>
2. Millennials have expressed satisfaction with our product variety and availability with comments like "Everything I needed." We should capitalize on this strength by promoting it more on our marketing channels. Highlighting this customer benefit can attract even more Millennials who appreciate convenient one-stop shopping experiences.
<br/>
3. It's been indicated by reviews from other generations that there is room for improvement when it comes to customer service. Comments such as "Do not buy from this company" and "Ridiculous Customer Service" suggest dissatisfaction with our current standards. We should dive deeper into this issue and create a plan to improve service for these customers. This could include additional training or revamping our customer service protocols.
<br/>
4. The dataset shows a significant weakness in our company's drive-thru service. Millennials, in particular, have expressed dissatisfaction with phrases like "Takes forever drive thru," "slow drive-thru" and "Slowest drive-thru ever." The drive-thru service's speed and efficiency need to be significantly improved to retain and increase our customer satisfaction.
<br/>
5. Negative feedback also indicates our stores may be understaffed and poorly maintained. Millennials gave feedback such as "Understaffed" and "Dirty, dirty." Addressing these issues should be a priority to improve shopping experiences. Potential actions may include hiring more staff and instituting stricter cleanliness standards and routines.
<br/>
6. Several reviews from non-Millennial customers have mentioned poor phone experiences, with "Phone hold times are horrible" and "Don't waste your money" being some of the comments. It's crucial to streamline our phone service, possibly by implementing an improved automated system or increasing operators during peak hours. A smooth phone communication can significantly impact customer satisfaction.
