<p>1. Promote Exceptional Customer Service: Based on the strength categories from millennials, they appreciate good customer service and supportive staff interactions, like the warm reception from employees such as Margaret and Steve. Therefore, continue to invest in excellent customer service training for all staff and possibly reward team members who continuously demonstrate exceptional service. </p>
<p>2. Improve Speed and Efficiency at Drive-Thru: It appears that the slow service at the drive-thru, particularly for millennials, is a major weakness. Therefore, investing resources into improving efficiency and speed of service at the drive-thru would greatly enhance customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>3. Ensure Store Cleanliness: Millennials have pointed out a weakness in store cleanliness. Therefore, regular and thorough cleaning should be implemented and monitored to ensure all stores maintain a high standard of hygiene.</p>
<p>4. Promote Diversity of Products: One of the strengths mentioned by millennials is the availability of needed items. Continue offering a wide range of products and services that cater to varying customer needs as this clearly resonates well with this demographic.</p>
<p>5. Address Language and Cultural Sensitivity: Feedback from customers from other generations indicates poor experiences due to difficulties in language fluency. Consider diversity and inclusion training for staff members to ensure all customers feel welcomed and valued, regardless of their language or ethnicity. </p>
<p>6. Improve Phone Service: Phone hold times and rude phone service were mentioned as weaknesses by other generations. It would be beneficial to train staff on proper phone etiquette and possibly expand the team handling phone communications to reduce hold times.</p>
