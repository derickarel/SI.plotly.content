            Millennials identified strengths such as 'pleasurable shopping experience' and 'great customer service.' These appear to be appreciated significantly more by this age group. The second focus group accents the weaknesses witnessed among millennials, with commonly noted terms including 'takes forever drive thru' and 'slow drive-thru'.  As for the non-millennials, the data shows the strengths they value the most in CVS's service, with reviews highlighting 'great customer service' and the cost issue around 'tampons are expensive'. In contrast, notable weaknesses among non-millennials include complaints like 'do not buy from this company'.
