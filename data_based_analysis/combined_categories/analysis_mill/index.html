            The attached data provides a comprehensive marketing analysis of four main groups based on strengths and weaknesses. The first group particularly relates to the strengths identified among millennials where certain terms such as 'pleasurable shopping experience' and 'great CS from Margaret' are mentioned to be appreciated significantly more by this age group. The second focus group accents the weaknesses witnessed among millennials, with commonly noted terms including 'takes forever drive thru' and 'slow drive-thru'. 

As for the non-millennials, the data shows the strengths they value the most in CVS's service, with reviews highlighting 'great customer service' and the cost issue around 'tampons are expensive'. In contrast, notable weaknesses among non-millennials include complaints like 'do not buy from this company' and 'good customer service by store manager'. This data richly informs marketing strategies that can be implemented to cater to these particular aspects, enhancing strengths and addressing weaknesses faced by CVS across different age demographics. Please find attached the HTML document with detailed data for further review and analysis.
