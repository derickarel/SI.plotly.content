	<title>Marketing Overview and Recommendations for CVS GenZ Customers</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Marketing Overview</h1>
	<p>The data shows significant customer dissatisfaction with CVS (specifically the GenZ demographic), primarily associated with the drive through service. Complaints are particularly around long wait times and inefficiency. Two primary labels emerge: "Avoid at all cost" and "Terrible drive thru". The percentage variance explained for these labels are 0.44% and 0.21% respectively. This indicates that the dissatisfaction with the drive-thru service does not explain a large amount of variance, however, it is a recurring theme that can't be ignored.</p>
	<p></p>

	<h1>Marketing Recommendations</h1>
	<p>1. CVS should prioritize improving its drive-thru service. This can be achieved by implementing system upgrades or increasing staffing during peak times to handle the rush.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>2. Another line of action could be optimizing the drive-thru layout to facilitate better traffic flow. This would help in efficiently managing the long queues and reducing wait times.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>3. Building on convenience - CVS could consider introducing features such as a dedicated pickup window for drive-thru customers or app-based pre-ordering services to boost customer experience.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>4. The feedback from GenZ customers suggests that they value speed and convenience. CVS should therefore leverage technology and introduce digital solutions to meet these needs. For example, queue updates in real-time for customers in the drive-thru can help manage customer expectations and enhance their experience.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>5. Improving staff skills and training could also lead to better customer service and consequently, a better perception of CVS. Polite and quick service can enhance customer experiences significantly.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>6. Finally, with the increasing importance of Corporate Social Responsibility, CVS could also communicate their green initiatives better. For example, their efforts towards reducing emissions through efficient operations of their drive-thrus. This could help improve their image with GenZ customers who have demonstrated strong interest in environmental issues.</p>
