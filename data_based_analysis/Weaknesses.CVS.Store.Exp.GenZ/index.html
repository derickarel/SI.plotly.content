<h2>Marketing Overview</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attached data looks at the weaknesses identified by Generation Z customers of CVS stores and the related experiences. There are two major themes that arise from this data - the customer experience connected with the label "Avoid at all cost" and issues related to "Terrible drive thru". The first carries 0.44% of the variance, whereas the second accounts for 0.21% of the variance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For "Avoid at all cost", customers indicate dissatisfaction of extreme measures. This indicates a dissatisfaction so severe that it deters them from using the CVS drive-through service or even visiting the store entirely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Terrible drive thru" surfaces complaints about slow and inefficient drive-through services. These are manifested in problems such as long waiting times, sometimes with as few as two cars ahead and slow response times. This theme is important because of how much drive-through services play into the overall satisfaction of a shopping experience, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when many customers are likely to opt for this service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Marketing Recommendations</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1.</b> CVS should acknowledge and take corrective measures concerning the perceived poor service quality, particularly with the drive-thru service. This could include staff training and improving processes to reduce wait times. Increased efficiency can significantly enhance the customer experience and reduce the negative sentiments among Generation Z consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Investigating into specific complaints related to "Avoid at all cost" and "Terrible drive thru" could provide deeper insights. For example, whether certain locations or specific times of the day are particularly problematic. This analysis could guide operational resource allocation better, such as staff rostering or adding additional pharmacy windows in high traffic times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3.</b> The implementation of an efficient online booking system for picking up medicines at the drive-thru might help manage customer expectations better, reduce wait times, and improve overall service experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4.</b> As the reviews hint at rude and slow service, it could be beneficial to run customer service training programs for staff members to improve their interpersonal skills. Another recommendation could be to invest in additional staff during peak times to manage the higher customer traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The company might want to utilize the customer complaints and use them as an opportunity to connect with Generation Z customers. By reaching out to customers who post negative reviews and working to resolve their issues, CVS can demonstrate that they value their customers' feedback and are committed to improving their services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Finally, given the frequency of comments around slow service, introducing a service quality standard and routinely measuring against it might be beneficial. For instance, limiting the drive-thru wait time to a particular limit and if the service is slower, provide a discount or complimentary service on their next visit could be a great way to handle customer dissatisfaction and promote the CVS brand as a customer-centric one.</p>
