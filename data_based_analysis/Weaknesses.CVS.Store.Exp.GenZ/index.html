<h2 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Marketing Overview</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
Based on the provided data attached, it seems that one of the major pain points centered around Generation Z customers’ experiences with CVS (specifically through the lens of weaknesses) is the operation of the drive-through service. Many customers voiced dissatisfaction with inefficient operation and long wait times. With labels, "Terrible drive thru" and "Avoid at all cost" being significantly highlighted, it could energetically influence the company's reputation and overall customer retention within this demographic. It's notable to express that the impact of these labels, in relevance to the associated percentage variance, shows an influence on customer behavior in selecting and frequenting their preferred pharmacy.
