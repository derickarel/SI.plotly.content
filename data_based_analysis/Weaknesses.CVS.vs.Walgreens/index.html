    <h2>Marketing Recommendations</h2>
    <h3>Recommendation 1</h3>
    <p>Both CVS and Walgreens need to recognize the importance of phone lines as a vital point of contact for customers. It's recommended to implement strict protocols to ensure all calls are answered promptly. This could include monitoring response times and providing staff training focused on phone etiquette.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation 3</h3>
