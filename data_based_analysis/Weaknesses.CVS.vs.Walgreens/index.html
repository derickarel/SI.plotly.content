        <h2>Marketing Overview</h2>
        <p>The provided data specifically analyses phrases that are highlighted more by dissatisfied customers when comparing CVS and Walgreens. Notably, terms like 'ANSWER YOUR', 'Horrible service.', 'ANSWER YOUR PHONES', 'Totally Unrel', 'Horrible automated phone', 'Rude Customer Service', 'Worst CVS', and '3-26-' recur more frequently. These remarks indicate dissatisfaction with customer service, particularly in terms of phone service and interpersonal interactions. There's a clear suggestion that customers are experiencing issues with reaching the pharmacies over the phone and encountering rude service when they do.</p>

        <p>The complaint phrases explain variations in customer satisfaction from just under 10% (e.g., 'ANSWER YOUR') to approximately 2% ('3-26-'). Therefore, addressing these complaints could potentially increase customer satisfaction by this degree. Furthermore, the negative rating scores elucidate that these aspects are areas of considerable weakness for CVS and Walgreens.</p>

        <h2>Marketing Recommendations</h2>

        <p>1. Improve phone response: Evidently, consumers are frequently aggrieved by the businesses not answering their phones. Therefore, it could be beneficial to hire more phone operators or invest in an automated system that can handle simple enquiries and free up staff for more complex calls.</p>

        <p>2. Enhance customer service training: The term 'Horrible service.' was conspicuous in the data. This suggests the need for CVS and Walgreens to invest in comprehensive customer service training to ensure all employees can offer service that meets or exceeds customer expectations.</p>

        <p>3. Asses relevance of communications: 'Totally Unrel' seems to indicate that customers are receiving irrelevant communication or information. A more targeted and personalized communication strategy could result in better customer engagement.</p>

        <p>4. Address and improve online reviews: Customers have labeled the service at these pharmacies as 'Worst CVS.' This signifies a reputation concern that the pharmacies need to address by responding to customer reviews, addressing their issues, and improving the service quality at these locations.</p>

        <p>5. Upgrade automated phone system: Customers have labelled the automated phone system 'horrible'. An upgrade to a more user-friendly and effective automated system could be much appreciated by the customers.</p>

        <p>6. Strive for consistency in store operating hours: The phrase '3-26-' could indicate inconsistency or confusion about store operating hours. Therefore, it would be worthwhile for these drugstores to establish consistency in their operating hours or at least communicate any changes clearly to their customers.</p>
