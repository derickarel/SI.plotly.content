<h2>Marketing Overview</h2>
<p>The data reflects four significant segments relevant to threats when comparing CVS vs Walgreens: pharmacy services, shopping experience, photo department, and passport photo service.

<p>In the pharmacy services, the top comments are positive and focus on the quality of service, try to leverage this in marketing strategies. In the shopping experience, the attention is on a variety of quality items. This gives an inhibitor that customers value a wide selection of high-quality items.
