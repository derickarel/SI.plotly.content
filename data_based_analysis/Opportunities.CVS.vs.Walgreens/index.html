    <h1>Marketing Overview</h1>
    <p>The dataset presents information organized into four groups based on distinct customer experiences and opinions about CVS and Walgreens pharmacies. The majority of reviews indicate a weakness in customer service with complaints about long waiting times, lack of response to phone calls, and perceived incompetence. The provided negative experiences make up a high percentage variance, implying wide consensus among the customers. This situation presents a significant opportunity to improve customer service and consequently improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. However, there are a couple of positive reviews that denote good customer service experiences, presenting a strength within these operations that can be built upon. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <h1>Marketing Recommendations</h1>

    <p>1. Enhance Customer Service: Both CVS and Walgreens should focus on improving their customer service. Training programs should be implemented to enhance employee-customer interactions and ensure that customer complaints are handled promptly and effectively.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>2. Improve Wait Times: Several complaints highlight lengthy wait times. Therefore, the pharmacies should focus on streamlining their processes and increasing efficiency, to reduce customer waiting times both in-store and on their customer support lines.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>3. Monitor and Respond to Customer Reviews: Closely monitor and respond to customer reviews and complaints online. This not only helps in improving operations but also shows customers that you value their opinions.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>4. Enhance Phone Response: Several reviews mention that the phone lines are not adequately staffed, leading to long wait times or no response. CVS and Walgreens need to prioritize this and ensure adequate staffing to handle customer calls. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>5. Increase Staff Levels during Peak Hours: If the volume of customers peaks at certain times of the day, it might be worth considering scheduling more employees during these times to ensure that the customer experience is not hampered.</p> 

    <p> </p>

    <p>6. Celebrate Positive Reviews: Positive reviews mentioning good customer service should be highlighted and the employees praised. This would not only encourage the employees to continue with their good service but also promote a positive image of the company in the consumer market.</p>
