<li><b>Focus on Acne Products:</b> Characteristic reviews show mixed response towards acne treating products. However, there seems to be a more positive response to the products treating acne than other items as the negative reviews for this group is only at 15.7%. Therefore, it'd be beneficial for marketing campaigns to put more emphasis on the efficacy and gentleness of CVS's acne products while assuring improved product quality to those who expressed concerns.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Allergy Warning and Testing:</b> Around 50.6% of negative reviews indicated that customers had allergic reactions to CVS products. It's essential to prioritize safety in marketing efforts by including a reminder to customers to conduct a patch test before fully applying a product, particularly if the product is new, reformulated, or if they have sensitive skin. Highlighting efforts CVS is taking to reduce allergic reactions could also be beneficial. </li>
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Product Refinement:</b> The reviews underline some quality issues with certain products, with 78.8% of customers dissatisfied with the product they used due to different reasons such as product causing breakouts or being overly drying. CVS should consider these comments in refining the product formulas. This refinement should be part of the marketing message to show customers that their feedback is taken seriously and to promote the improved products.
