        <li><b>Highlight CVS' Unique and Quality Products:</b> Reviews indicated that many shoppers have a high opinion of CVS products, particularly the branded products like "Tatcha Indigo Overnight" and the "best face wash ever". They mention that these give them a "beautiful dewy hydrant look", "soft and pink lips", and help in "clearing up dry patches". With a focus on their branded, exclusive products, CVS can emphasize its unique offerings and align marketing messages to reaffirm these products' qualities and benefits. Advertising could include customer testimonials praising their unique in-house brands.</li><br>

        <li><b>Focus on the Positive Effects of Products on Skin:</b> Numerous reviews mentioned that they achieved "hydrated", "glowing", and "untextured and smooth" skin by using CVS' products, ranking these observations higher than other points. CVS should emphasize these benefits in their marketing campaigns, demonstrating how their products lead to results that customers desire. They could even create a campaign around skin positivity, tying their products directly into a broader narrative about self-care and the importance of skincare.</li><br>
        
        <li><b>Promote Gentle, Non-Drying Cleansers:</b> Several reviews praise the fact that CVS offers "excellent gentle" and "non-drying" cleansers. Considering the importance of these characteristics for their customers, CVS should prominently feature these items in both their in-store and online skincare sections. Marketing campaigns could center around the gentleness of their skincare products and their effectiveness in cleansing without stripping the skin of essential moisture.</li>
