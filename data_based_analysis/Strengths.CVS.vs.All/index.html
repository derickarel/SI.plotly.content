  <li>CVS should emphasize their range of effective skincare and beauty products. Customers were especially impressed with their facial cleansers and moisturizers, indicating these as 'excellent' and 'gentle yet effective'. For example, comments such as "Excellent gentle cleanser that cleans without drying" and "This gives a beautiful dewy hydrant look to the skin and feels amazing and hydrating" indicate strong customer satisfaction. Prioritizing advertisements for these products could further attract consumers looking for quality skincare.</li>
