<ul>
<li><strong>Address Skin Reaction Concerns:</strong> Reviews indicate that customers have experienced negative skin reactions to some CVS competitors products, like allergic reactions and breakouts. CVS should ensure their product selection includes hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic items, and emphasize this in their marketing communication to assure customers of the safety and gentleness of their products.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Emphasize Effective Acne Solutions:</strong>  Some reviews revealed that competitor products were appreciated for their effectiveness in combatting acne. To target this audience, CVS could enhance its range of acne-fighting products, while emphasizing the safety and non-irritating properties of these products in marketing campaigns.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Promote Gentle, Non-Irritating Skin Care:</strong> Based on the reviews, there is a percentage of customers that are sensitive to harsh, burning or tingly sensations caused by competitor products. CVS could focus a marketing campaign around their gentle skincare line, emphasizing soothing and calming ingredients that do not cause discomfort or irritation.</li>
