            The collected customer reviews and their sentiment percentages reveal a range of issues with the product and service. For the product, customers complained about issues such as receiving a product that was "half empty" (96.77%), rancid or expired content (75.74%), a product that was watered down (75.61%), and that led to skin discoloration or "made their face turn orange" (68.70%). Furthermore, some found the product sizes to be misleadingly small (28.73%), and few accused the item of being non-authentic (47.13%).

In terms of service, complaints of false advertising led the charge (55.47%), there were issues with no refunds or returns (63.24%), and few accused the product of not providing value for money, labeling a complete "Waste of money" (63.24%).

However, customers praised customer service (100%) despite product issues, highlighting it as a redeeming factor. While the overall satisfaction level did not hold high due to product-related problems, positive feedback about the customer service shows areas where the company is succeeding.

Suggestions for improvements derived from this include stricter quality control to ensure products aren't damaged or expired, closer adherence to advertised sizes and expectations, and ensuring product descriptions are accurate to prevent claims of false advertising.
