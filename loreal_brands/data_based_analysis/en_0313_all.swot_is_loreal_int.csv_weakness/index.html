            In your feedback, it appears that multiple customers were dissatisfied with the actual delivery and condition of the product upon arrival. Many have reported receiving the item in a damaged or unusable state, with the product leaking or spilling out in transit. This has affected customer satisfaction as the product appears to be half empty or broken, especially the pump dispenser.

In terms of the product itself, some users have reported a white residue left on their face after application causing a negative reaction. There is also a note about a peculiar smell, although this didn't seemingly affect the performance of the product according to one reviewer. Some customers appreciated that the moisturizer was fragrance-free, while others detected a strong scent possibly due to certain essential oils included in the formula.

One thing that seemed to have worked well for customers is its effectiveness against jawline and cystic acne, with multiple users reporting clear improvements in their skin condition after using the product.

However, there are some concerns about specific ingredients in the product that are considered harmful, with even a mention of alcohol, which has been found not suitable for some skin types. 

In order to improve the overall customer experience, I recommend looking into a more secure packaging and shipment process to ensure the product arrives intact and full. Also, considering feedback about the white cast, the formulation should possibly be reviewed. The fragrance concern seems to be subjective, but if multiple customers raise similar concerns about the strong scent, that feedback should be taken into consideration. Lastly, product reassurances or detailed information regarding any ingredients of concern could also be beneficial for customer understanding and product confidence.
