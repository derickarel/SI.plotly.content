            Based on the provided data, I would suggest the team to focus on improving the following areas:

1. Packaging &amp; Delivery - Majority of the customers have stated their packages arrived damaged or half empty. Ensure stronger packaging and partner with trustworthy delivery networks to enhance customer satisfaction.
   
2. Quality Assurance - Customers reported receiving products without safety seals, leading to concerns over hygiene and product authenticity. This issue should be addressed by our team by ensuring every product is properly sealed before dispatched for delivery.

3. Quality of the Product - Complaints include rancid smell, watered down products, and allergic reactions. Regular and stringent quality checks should be implemented along with clear display of ingredients to avoid allergic reactions.

4. Marketing &amp; Product effectiveness - Many customers felt the product to be a waste of money as it either turned their face orange or didn't have any impact. Marketing team should consider this feedback to reassess their product positioning and advertisements to set realistic customer expectations. 

5. Customer Service - While there are mentions of good customer service, there were also negative reviews. Strengthening the customer service team will save the reputation of the company.
