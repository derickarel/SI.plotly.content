            As a marketing professional, you are often tasked to analyze customer reviews for valuable insights. These labels focus on common themes found within the reviews:

1. "Great product and customer service" (95.6% relevance): Positive product feedback and acknowledgment of excellent customer support. For example, "Good customer service but products does nothing."

2. "Rancid and rancid" (72.4% relevance): Complaints of the product bearing a rancid or expired smell. For example, "It stinks and smells rotten and old, almost 5 years old and smelled rancid."

3. "WATERED DOWN" (72.3% relevance): Customers indicating the product has been diluted. A common statement could be "Product seems watered down."

4. "Turned my face orange" (65.7% relevance): Refer to any complexion-related adverse reactions such as "It turned my skin yellow."

5. "Waste of money" (60.5% relevance): Customers who report dissatisfaction with their purchase or consider the product not worth its cost. A customer might say "It did nothing waste of money."

6. "Burns my face" (55.9% relevance): Signals about negative physical reactions from using the product like "It gave me a burning sensation."

7. "Many good comments of this product" (54.1% relevance): Appreciation of the product's strengths, user experience, or results. For example, "Many good comments of this product."

8. "Bottle arrived half empty" (53.9% relevance): Complaints about inadequate product quantity or packaging defects like "Bottle came half empty."

9. "Rip off false advertising" (53% relevance): Grievances about misleading product information or instances where customers received a different article from what was advertised. An example might be "Sent a smaller size bottle than described, 18 oz instead of 33 oz."

10. "Not Authentic" (45.1% relevance): Doubts or claims about the product's originality. A common grievance could be "item was not authentic." 

These labels can help pinpoint areas for improvement - packaging, advertising accuracy, formulation, and user experience - to enhance customer satisfaction.
