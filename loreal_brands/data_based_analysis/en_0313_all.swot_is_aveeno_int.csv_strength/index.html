            This campaign will focus on features like "Sun protection and moisturizing", "Glow enhancement", and "Providing a budget-friendly alternative for higher-end brands" as the customer reviews indicate a preference for these traits. We will highlight these features to reach nearly 50% (0.197189192 + 0.172342218 + 0.129983257) of our potential market. 

Our messaging will place emphasis on the product's lightweight and moisturizing formulation, which importantly also offers sun protection, tied to comments about "Great light weight coverage" and "Sun protection very light weight everyday use". Another key aspect of our marketing strategy will be illuminating the glow-boosting properties of the product, from customers who enjoyed the "rosy glow" and "perfect shine". 

Furthermore, a unique aspect of our product, as identified from the reviews, is its ability to show significant results for fine lines and wrinkles even at older ages, thus making it attractive for customers of varied age groups. 

Also, an important part of the consumer feedback indicated that our product serves as an effective dupe for luxury brands like drunk elephant. This presents an opportunity to position our product as a cost-effective substitute that delivers comparable results.

Finally, there is strong feedback about the product making the skin look "brighter and healthier", and it successfully evening out skin tone, which will also form key message points for our marketing communications.

The campaign will employ a positive testimonial strategy, leveraging real customer reviews and highlighting the product's ability to deliver a variety of benefits to meet diverse skincare needs.
