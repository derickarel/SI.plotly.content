            Title: User Experience and Customer Reviews Analysis

2. Watered Down (99.8%): Another common concern was the consistency of the product. Reviews claim it seems diluted, stating it is watered down and not as effective.

3. Orange Complexion (90.7%): Many users reported an undesirable skin color change after application, notably an orange or yellowish tint. 

4. Waste of Money(83.5%): Customers indicated dissatisfaction in the product's performance, considering it ineffective and consequently, a waste of money.

5. False Advertising (73.2%): Complaints were lodged about misleading product descriptions, wrong sizes, and missing items; the product received didn't match what was advertised.

6. Authenticity Concerns (62.2%): Doubts about the product's genuineness emerged, with customers noticing discrepancies like alterations in the logo.

7. "Oompa Loompa" Effect (32%): A trend emerged where users felt their complexion resembled the fictional Oompa Loompa character from Willy Wonka, due to the product's tan or orange effects.

8. Short Expiration Date (29.6%): Consumers expressed discontentment with the short expiry date of the product, suggesting it was nearing expiration upon receipt.

In light of this feedback, we suggest immediate steps in rectifying these grievances, helping us improve user experience and brand reputation.
Please notify QA and Manufacturing departments to address quality and packaging concerns and plan a strategy to contact and potentially compensate dissatisfied customers. Additionally, disciplinary action should be taken against suppliers and vendors involved in the case of false advertising. Finally, initiate a thorough product review for authenticity.
