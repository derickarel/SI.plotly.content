            Based on customer reviews, the key features and benefits of the product under review are its sun protection and moisturizing capabilities, silky smooth texture, and the glowing effect it gives the skin.

Having 22.98% of comments, the most highly-praised characteristic is the product's ability to provide sun protection and moisture. This makes it an excellent lightweight everyday use product, which users have described as meeting or exceeding their expectations.

Around 16.40% of users mention the added glow the product gives their skin, expressing their appreciation for the lovely shimmer and luminous finish it provides.

A significant portion of users also compare this product to the high-end brand Drunk Elephant, describing it as a fantastic 'dupe' or alternative. This accounts for roughly 12.84% of comments.

Other characteristics worth noting are the product's anti-aging capabilities. Approximately 9.00% of customers report that it improves the appearance of their 80-year-old skin, making it look younger and more hydrated.

Furthermore, about 8.19% of users have noticed that their skin looks brighter and healthier after using the product, expressing how it enhances the softness and smoothness of their skin.
