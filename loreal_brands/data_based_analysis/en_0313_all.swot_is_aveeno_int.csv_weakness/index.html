            Review: "This product seems watered down and left my face looking orange. It was a total waste of money and worst of all, it caused a burning sensation on my face. Despite the many good comments I've read about it, I doubt its authenticity due to the changes in my skin. It also left the worst white cast making me look like an Oompa Loompa and to top it off, the expiration date is way too short. It even made my eyes puffier and irritated. Not at all what I expected!"
