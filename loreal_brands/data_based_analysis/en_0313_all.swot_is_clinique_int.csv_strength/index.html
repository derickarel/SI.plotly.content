            These labels and characteristics can be interpreted as follows: 

"Sun protection and moisturizing" (0.303332624%): This indicates that a significant number of consumers appreciate the product for its sun protection and moisturizing properties. Characteristics reviews, such as "Sun protection very light weight everyday use" and "Lite weight and provides great moisture," support this observation.

"Super, super" (0.265110967%): These repeated words might indicate high enthusiasm, possibly regarding the product's effectiveness or appeal. However, without more context, it isn't very clear what this refers to. 

"Silky smooth and moisturizing" (0.216559439%): Consumers commonly describe the product as making their skin appears smooth and moisturized. The phrases "silky smooth and moisturizing" and "Leaves skin silky soft and smoothe!!" in the reviews support this inference. 

"Glow, glow" (0.19995093%): This is likely referring to the glow or radiance that customers notice on their skin after using the product. The review "Gives a perfect glow" confirms this interpretation. 

"Great dupe for the drunk" (0.169519122%): The product is regarded as a cost-effective or comparable quality alternative ("dupe") to a presumably pricier product from the brand, Drunk Elephant. 

"Lightweight and absorbs quickly" (0.129890145%): As this phrase suggests, consumers appreciate the product for its lightweight texture and quick absorption. The review "Absorbs quickly with NO greasy feeling." affirms this claim. 

"Makes my 80 year old" (0.118829916%): This statement suggests the product helps improve the skin appearance of older consumers, as one over80-year-old user has noted that it makes their skin "look younger and moist". 

"love it my skin looks brighter and healthier" (0.108087473%): Many users found the product greatly improved their skin's health and brightness. 

"Quick, easy" (0.085378796): This suggests that consumers found the product fast and simple to use. 

"My favorite lip balm" (0.0%): Despite a 0.0% percentage, the dataset includes reviews that mentioned the product being a favorite lip balm, such as "My favorite lip balm" and "Love burts bee lip balm". This could have been mentioned in a small number of reviews, indicating perhaps that not all consumers see it as their favorite, or many reviews did not specifically comment on this aspect.
