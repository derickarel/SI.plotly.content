<h2>Marketing Overview</h2>
<p> Looking into the datasets provided, we can observe different strengths and weaknesses within CVS' current market positioning based on two categories: GenZ and non-GenZ customers. The external factors highlight customer preferences in comparison with competitors like Rite Aid and the internal factors focus on customer service and efficient prescription handling. Understanding these factors and their corresponding characteristic reviews provide the foundation for developing strategic marketing implications and recommendations. </p>

<h2>Marketing Recommendations</h2>
<p>1. To capitalize on CVS' perceived strength over competitors like Rite Aid, launch marketing campaigns that provide comparative messaging emphasizing CVS' edge in convenience, customer service, and product inventory over competitors. Make these promotions seen on platforms where non-GenZ customers frequently engage, with messaging that corresponds with their preferences as revealed in the characteristic reviews. </p>

<p>2. Address the identified weakness about being understaffed as communicated by non-GenZ customers. Establish a program to improve staffing during peak hours or important days. Make sure that this improvement is well-communicated to customers through various marketing channels. </p>

<p>3. From GenZ's perspective, great customer service has been appreciated. Continue to provide excellent services by motivating and rewarding employees for delivering friendliness, professionalism, and helpfulness, qualities that GenZ values. Leverage this strength by incorporating real-life positive reviews in marketing materials to attract more GenZ customers. </p>

<p>4. Pay attention to the feedback given by GenZ customers regarding the prescription handling. Make a marketing campaign that informs customers about any new measures to ensure accurate and efficient handling of prescriptions. Aim this campaign at GenZ customers who are currently dissatisfied with these aspects of service. </p>

<p>5. Resolving issues about auto-refills can be taken as an opportunity to upgrade CVS' auto-refill system. Emphasize this improved feature by conducting a targeted marketing campaign underlining the convenience of the upgraded system while addressing GenZ customersâ€™ concerns. </p>

<p>6. For both GenZ and non-GenZ customers, develop a customer-friendly script directing phone calls in a more approachable and efficient way. Share this improvement through marketing content where both audiences engage, focusing on their specific communication preferences. </p>
