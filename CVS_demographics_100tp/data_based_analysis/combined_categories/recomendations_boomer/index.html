            1. The store excels in "Knowledgeable, Kind, Professional - Excellent Customer Service" with a high percentage variance of 0.904. Building upon this strength can create a trusted professional image for the store, as customer service is a big deciding factor for many shoppers. Consider advocating for consistent and detailed training for all employees. 
            <br/><br/><br/>
            
            2. A strong point of the store is the vast array of "Beauty, care, brands" available, with many customers appreciating the options. Use this strength for marketing campaigns aiming to let shoppers know about the wide range of products in stock and leveraging the positive customer reviews that highlight variety.
            <br/><br/><br/>
            
            3. Several characteristic reviews show high admiration for the "Ulta Salon", which is a strength in the category where Boomers are more interested. Use this preference for salon services to create marketing campaigns to capture the interest of Boomers. Increased advertising of salon services, or offering special promotions at the salon, might entice more Boomer customers. 
            <br/><br/><br/>
            
            4. A weakness that needs addressing is the "Ridiculously long lines". Despite this issue only affecting a small percentage of customers, reducing wait times can greatly improve the customer experience for all shoppers. Consider implementing more efficient checkout methods like self-serve options or online payments.
            <br/><br/><br/> 
            
            5. Weaknesses also lie in the area of lacking customer service especially where younger generations are considered. Reviews highlight that customers feel "Racially profiled" and they experienced the "Worst customer service ever". Implement sensitivity training and diversity awareness programs for employees to ensure everyone feels welcomed and valued.
            <br/><br/><br/>  
            
            6. Another weakness lies in the perceived deficiency in "African American beauty products". Inclusion and diversity are important to most shoppers today, and failing to accommodate this need could deter a significant number of customers. To address this, consider expanding the range of products aimed towards African American customers.
