      Millennials are generally pleased with their experience at CVS stores, particularly admiring the excellent customer service and professional attitudes of staff. Recommendations and assistance with makeup selections are highly appreciated, showing that expertise and hospitality are the company's core strengths. However, the clean presentation of stores and availability of diverse products may need improvement in some locations.

      Negative customer experiences often involve accusations of poor service or allegations of racial profiling, indicating a need to enforce more rigorous training and sensitivity standards among CVS employees. Improving these weaknesses will likely lead to a significant improvement in customer satisfaction, especially among key demographic groups such as millennials.
