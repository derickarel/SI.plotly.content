            Gen-Z customers appreciate the quality of customer service at CVS, particularly the helpfulness of staff and the quality of salon services. However, there are areas of improvements such as better representation of beauty products suitable for African American customers and incidents of poor customer service that needs to be mitigated. This analysis suggests that CVS could further improve their appeal to Gen-Z by enhancing product diversity and reinforcing its strong customer service practices.
