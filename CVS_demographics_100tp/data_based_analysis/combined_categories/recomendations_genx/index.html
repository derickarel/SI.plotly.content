<li>Improve Customer Service: The data shows that older and younger generations mentioned dissatisfaction with customer service. The characteristic reviews such as "Rude employees", "Sales lady wasnt helpful", "Unfriendly employees" reveal this issue. Implementing better training programs for customer service, hiring more staff and fostering a welcoming store environment can enhance the shopping experience.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Expand Product Range: A weakness among the Gen-Z shoppers was the need for better African American beauty products. It's essential to ensure the product offering is diverse and caters to all ethnicities. Expanding the range of beauty products for different skin tones and hair types could attract more customers.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Maintain Cleanliness &amp; Organization: Older shoppers highlighted the importance of cleanliness and organization in the stores, with positive reviews such as "Clean and fully stocked", "Clean and well organized". Ensuring stores are well-maintained, well-organized, and well-stocked, can significantly enhance the customer's shopping experience.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Highlight Strengths in Marketing Efforts: For both older and younger customers, excellent customer service and helpfulness of the staff were notable strengths. Including real customer testimonials in marketing communications regarding knowledge and professionalism of staff, and stating the commitment to maintaining these standards, can be beneficial.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Address Shipping and Delivery Issues: Based on reviews, issues with shipping and delivery were a significant weakness pointed out by older generations. Streamlining the delivery process and offering options like trackable shipping could improve customer satisfaction.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Review Pricing Strategy: Older customers had mixed opinions about product pricing. Reviews such as "Didn't honor price that was on sticker", "Everything is overpriced", should be taken into consideration while reviewing current pricing strategies. Offering clear, fair pricing can help improve this aspect of the customer experience<br/><br/></li>
