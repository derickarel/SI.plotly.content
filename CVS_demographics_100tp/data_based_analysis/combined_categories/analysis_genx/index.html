<p>CVS's Gen-X customers highly appreciate its excellent customer service, with many positive comments about the knowledgeable and kind staff. These customers find the stores well-organized, clean, and carrying a variety of beauty necessities. However, they also express concern and dissatisfaction related to issues like overpricing and poor customer service. There are also complaints about inadequate choices of beauty products catered to African American customers. In summary, while customer service and product variety are strengths of the CVS experience for Gen-X customers, there are areas for improvement in pricing and product selection tailored to diverse customers.</p>
