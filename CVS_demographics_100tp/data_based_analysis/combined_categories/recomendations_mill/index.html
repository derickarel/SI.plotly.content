<li>Prioritize Enhancement of Customer Service:  Many positive reviews refer to great customer service and knowledgeable staff assisting customers in-store. It's important to set a higher standard for customer service training. This will ensure that every customer interaction is positive and encourages repeat business.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Improved Store Aesthetics and Cleanliness:  Customers note that clean, well-organized stores have a positive impact on their shopping experience. However, negative comments related to store cleanliness and organization were present. Periodic deep cleaning and consistent tidiness in-store should be prioritized to appeal to shopper's needs for a clean, inviting shopping experience.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Enhance Product Availability and Representation:  Some shoppers, specifically within African American demographics, felt the store lacked diversity in their product offerings. Expanding the range of products to cater for a diverse customer base including different cultures, hair types, and skin tones can help everyone feel included.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Capitalize on Positive Reviews regarding In-store Services and Experiences:  Comments praised services such as hair styling and brow waxing. In-store service experiences should be promoted and possibly expanded, as these opportunities generate foot traffic and elevate customer satisfaction.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Leverage Strength in Gift Cards Sales:  Apparently, customers appreciate the convenience of gift cards for presents. Therefore, efforts to promote gift card sales, especially during holiday seasons or special events, could attract additional business.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Improve Training To Prevent Customer Profiling Incidents:  Negative experiences mentioned were around staff profiling customers. Mandatory anti-bias and sensitivity training should be given to employees, fostering an environment of respect, free from discrimination.<br/><br/></li>
