<li>Competitor Strength: Consumers seem to connect the quality of their competitor's juice with words such as 'Yummy', 'Delicious', and 'Healthy'. <br/><i>Marketing Recommendation: </i> Tropicana should focus on promoting the health benefits and flavor quality of their products to match these perceptions.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Competitor Strength: Consumers are willing to pay for these competing juices despite their high price, seeing them as 'Worth every penny'. <br><i>Marketing Recommendation: </i>Tropicana could consider highlighting the value for money and overall worth of their product in their marketing strategies.<br/><br/></br></li>
<li>Competitor Weakness: Consumers talk negatively about their experiences related to shipping and the condition of the products upon arrival, such as 'Cans arrived damaged and leaking', 'Bottles arrived broken'. <br><i>Marketing Recommendation: </i>Tropicana should emphasize on their reliable and secure packaging and shipping, differentiating themselves from competitors that have problems in these areas.<br/><br/></br></li>
