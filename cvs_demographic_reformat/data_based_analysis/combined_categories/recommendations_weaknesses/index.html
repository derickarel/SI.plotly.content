<li>Specific skin-care services and product offerings can be elevated, targeting Gen-X and Gen-Z who raised concerns about the lack of professional healthcare services such as dermatologists. For example, Gen-X mentioned "this is NOT a dermatologist" and Gen-Z discussed about "Nurse Practitioners". Offering a higher standard of skin-care service with licensed dermatologists in-store could be beneficial.<br/><br/></li>

<li>Provide clear and ethical advertising addressing concerns regarding medical claims with a specific focus on millennials who had the highest percentage variance for the trait "Homeopathy and herbal medicine". In response to reviews that suggest a lack of understanding or scepticism towards homeopathic products, provide informational resources that clarify the benefits and limitations of homeopathic and herbal products.<br/><br/></li>

<li>Promote transparency and authenticity with products sold both in-store and online as there are concerns from both Gen-X and Gen-Z customers regarding authenticity, specifically in relation to third-party sellers on online platforms such as Amazon.<br/><br/></li>

<li>Millennials have mentioned hormones and acne frequently. Consider offering a line of products addressing acne issues caused by hormonal imbalances as it could cater to this specific need.<br/><br/></li>

<li>Based on the reviews, Gen-Z and Millenial customers particularly focus on health and wellness with mentions of "Yoga with Adrienne" and "Is it worth the money?". Consider partnering with wellness personalities for exclusive product lines or promotional events to attract these health-conscious younger customers.<br/><br/></li>

<li>The characteristic review "takes scalding hot showers then complains about being hot afterwards" from millenials suggests a need for education on skincare. Demonstrating proper application or techniques of products will create more engagement on social channels, and could lend to in-store events and demonstrations.<br/><br/></li>
