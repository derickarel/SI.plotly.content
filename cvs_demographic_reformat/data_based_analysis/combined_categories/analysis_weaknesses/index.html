<p>The CVS shopping experience reveals varying areas of concern across different generations. Gen-X shoppers show a sense of dissatisfaction towards high standards being needed, expressed discomfort with TikTok-related items, and objected to the representation of dermatological knowledge. In contrast, Gen-Z consumers expressed similar complaints while also voicing concerns about feeling mentally challenged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Millenials focused more on dissatisfaction with dermatology misrepresentations but also expressed dissatisfaction with certain niche items like college related products and manicure services, suggesting the need for diverse, tailored services.</p>
<p>The range of feedback illuminates CVS's strengths and weaknesses, making clear the importance of creating and maintaining standards that cater to the diverse needs across all generations. This could include clearer and accurate descriptions of services, better product representation and improving standards where necessary.</p>
