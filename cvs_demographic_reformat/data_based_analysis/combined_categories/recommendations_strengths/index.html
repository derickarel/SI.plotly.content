<li>Focus on encouraging sharing: Both Boomer and Gen-X audiences express appreciation when information is shared ("Thanks a lot for sharing"). Messages that promote community sharing and provide valuable advice, tips, or insights would likely resonate well across these groups.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Highlight effectiveness in treating skin conditions: References to overcoming skin conditions, such as cyst acne, appear in Boomer, Gen-X, and Gen-Z feedback. Position products as solving these problems in brand messaging. For example, promote products that help control acne or rosacea and share customer successes.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Promote nostalgia: According to the strengths of Gen-X and Gen-Z, there is a strong sense of nostalgia tied to certain products or brand experiences. Leverage this in the brand's storytelling, perhaps highlighting the brand's heritage, long-standing product favorites, or memories associated with the brand.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Highlight product range: The strengths for Millenials indicate specific product recognition and satisfaction ("Olay Vitamin C+ AHA", "CeraVe makes the best darn ret"). Create marketing materials that highlight the range of effective products the store offers, potentially spotlighting customer favorites.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Address customer dissatisfaction: For Millenials, a strength was "I would summarize with these words: bad". This reflects some negative sentiments which must be addressed. Implement customer feedback systems and take necessary measures to ensure better customer experience.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Emphasize the importance of re-application: Millenials indicated the necessity to "Reapply several times per day". CVS could use this feedback to educate consumers on how to use products correctly for best results, providing an improved shopper experience and product satisfaction.<br/><br/></li>
