Shoppers at CVS stores have provided key insights into the strengths and weaknesses of brand. Gen-Z shoppers often mention the product color not suiting them well. Millenials raise concerns over allergic reactions and issues with the performance and durability of product packaging, such as defective pumps. The Gen-X and Baby Boomer shoppers express concerns regarding product authenticity, packaging, and other customer service issues like arrival of half-empty products. However, these older shoppers also appreciate the overall quality of the products. Understanding these differences can guide the enhancement of product offerings and customer service to meet the unique needs of each generation.
