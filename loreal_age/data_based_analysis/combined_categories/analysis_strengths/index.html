<p>Our data shows different strengths appreciated by various age groups shopping at CVS. Gen-Z shoppers frequently noted the fresh and clean feeling of products, along with their effectiveness in making skin soft and smooth. They also appreciate products that give a natural glow and are gentle on the skin. Generation X and Millennial shoppers, meanwhile, highlighted the non-greasy and lightweight nature of products, along with their efficacy as moisturizers. They also value them for their glow-enhancing and skin-smoothing capabilities. Baby Boomers, similar to their younger counterparts, place high importance on lightweight, non-greasy products that work well as daily moisturizers. They particularly appreciated the products' affordability and the fresh feeling they offer post-use.</p>
