<li>Target Gen-Z consumers by highlighting the light, fresh feel of products like the "best self tan" in marketing campaigns. User reviews praise how these products leave skin feeling "soft and hydrated", giving the skin a "fresh and clean feeling", while also producing a "beautiful bronze color".</li>

<li>For Gen-Z, consider creating marketing content in Spanish to capitalize on the "excelente producto" and "muy buen" products. This content could highlight how these products are "Efectivo" and create a good outcome for the users. Reviews in Spanish provided mention "Deja tu rostro su" and "Muy buen" which indicate a positive reception among Spanish-speaking customers. </li>
