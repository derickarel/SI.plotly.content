    <title>Marketing Analysis for Gen Z Customers - CVS Store Experience</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Marketing Summary</h1>
    <p>The bar chart illustrates the key performance indicators (KPIs) for strengths and weaknesses of a CVS store experience specifically for Gen Z customers. The strengths indicate a strong focus on customer service, with sentiments like "great helpful, friendly," "excellent customer service," and personalized acknowledgements suggesting that CVS staff are connecting effectively with Gen Z customers. These areas present the highest percentage variance, supporting their significance. On the other hand, weaknesses show a substantial negative reaction to the drive-thru experience, but this concern appears less prevalent compared to the strengths.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Marketing Recommendations:</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>1.</strong> Emphasize and promote the excellent customer service in marketing material, in order to appeal to Gen Z values of authenticity and personalized experiences.</p>

    <p><strong>2.</strong> Encourage store employees to continue providing individualized attention to customers, possibly by recognizing and rewarding employees who are frequently mentioned positively by customers.</p>
