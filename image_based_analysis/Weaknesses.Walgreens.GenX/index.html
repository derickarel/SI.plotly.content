<p>
    The bar chart provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the CVS store experience for Gen Z customers. 
    The left side of the chart details the strengths, focusing on customer service quality which is highlighted by key phrases such as "great, helpful, friendly," 
    "excellent customer service," and personalization with instances like "Cheryl is." Each of these attributes has a corresponding percentage, 
    indicating their significance to Gen Z's positive perception of the CVS store experience.
</p>

    On the right side, the chart illustrates the weaknesses, with a significant emphasis on negative phrases such as "terrible drive thru" and 
    "avoid at all costs." These are critical areas of concern, and though they are few, their impact is evidently strong enough to be noted as key weaknesses.
</p>
