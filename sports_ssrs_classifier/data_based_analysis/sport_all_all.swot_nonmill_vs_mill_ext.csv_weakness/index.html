            It seems like your text contains a mix of different topics and statements. These include, among others, news about sports (specifically baseball, soccer, basketball and car racing), a review or analysis about the Kung Fu Panda trilogy, demographic data on COVID deaths in California, news or opinions about pregnancy, a situation involving Sonic and child labor laws, and a question about what people do to save time during the day. Without more context, it's hard to provide a suitable marketing strategy. However, the variety of topics seems to attest a broad audience with interests in sports, movies, health, and societal issues. Therefore, a marketing strategy could revolve around creating segmented content that appeals to these different interest groups.
