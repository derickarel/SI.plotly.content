            As a marketing expert, I recommend a targeted approach in dealing with the labels and percentages provided. Here's my analysis:

1. Market, Oil, Energy: This topic has the highest percentage relevance, hence, the main focus should be energy market particularly oil. Effective strategies could be thought-leadership articles, informative blog posts, webinars about the energy market, and running ads targeting professionals in the energy sector based on the reviews. 

2. Elon Musk - Twitter: Despite the low percentage, Elon Musk's possible acquisition of Twitter is a hot topic. We could create engaging social media content and propose discussions around the potential impact of this move. 

3. Trump, Court, Supreme: Themes surrounding Trump and supreme court also have a fair percentage. This could be used to inform political commentary or discussions. 

4. Table tennis or ping pong: It has 0%, however, creating content about table tennis and ping pong for sports-related marketing might still attract niche audience interest.

5. Fan, fans, hockey, "Gotta love minor league baseball", Racing, Ons Jabeur (2): Despite 0%, these sports-related topics can be useful for sports marketing. Collaborating with sports influencers or running events-based campaigns during important matches could be effective.

6. Game-changer: This generic label could be incorporated into any campaign to create a sense of revolution or significant positive changes, regardless of the specific industry. 

7. Kung Fu Panda Trilogy: The case of incorporating pop culture items like the "Kung Fu Panda" trilogy might be used to draw attention to YouTube channels or related video content.

Remember, while percentage relevance is important, playing into emerging trends and buzzworthy topics can often yield results in capturing public attention and engagement.
