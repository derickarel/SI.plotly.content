            Based on contextual analysis, the AI predicts that the next topic of discussion will discuss a new TV show with a likelihood of 100%. This could possibly be a crossover of KOTH and Looney Tunes or a discussion about The Richard Dolan Show or The Book of Boba Fett. With a likelihood of around 79%, the conversation might shift to the Marvel Cinematic Universe dominating Hollywood or, in the least probability, conversations might turn to revered films like Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, and House. A slight possibility of 17% suggests topics could diverge into some of the greatest sporting events in history or perhaps even a boxing match involving Manny Pacqui√°o. New interests in hockey fans are at an almost negligible 9%. However, the least expected topics (&lt;1%) revolve around unfamiliar movie reviews, the change in football culture, tieflings' origins in mythology, sports like diving and football, and reviews for unknown classic mysteries.
